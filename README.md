# Behaviorial Cloning Project

Overview
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road

This project includes the following files:
* model.py containing the script to create and train the model
* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network

Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing 
```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```


Conclusion
---
In this project, I have learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. I have trained, validated and tested a model using Keras. The model outputs a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.

I used a simulator where I can steer a car around a track for data collection. I used image data and steering angles to train a neural network and then used this model to drive the car autonomously around the track.
