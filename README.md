# Behaviorial Cloning Project

Overview
---
This repository contains files for the Behavioral Cloning Project.

In this project, I have learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. I have trained, validated and tested a model using Keras. The model outputs a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.

I used a simulator where I can steer a car around a track for data collection. I used image data and steering angles to train a neural network and then used this model to drive the car autonomously around the track.

Please read the writeup report for more details about the project.
